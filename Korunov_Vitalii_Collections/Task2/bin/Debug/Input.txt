For many applications, you want to create and manage groups of related objects.
There are two ways to group objects: by creating arrays of objects, and by creating collections of objects.
Arrays are most useful for creating and working with a fixed number of strongly-typed objects. 
For information about arrays, see Arrays (C# Programming Guide).
